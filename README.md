INTRO:
This program is more of a random experimental type thing. I know I want to first make a simple webpage. Then add a backend. Then improve upon it for the front end. This will be a program that helps improve my full stack development skills. 

LANGUAGES USED:
HTML, CSS, and JS

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
Now I know what this program will be. It will be a webpage that will allow users to search up various stats or information they want. In the front end it may be check boxes, buttons, and maybe typing in for ranges and what not. These filters will be able to send input into the data stucture created and seem like a click and it will get the data, but behind the scenes that input will initiate a funciton with the passed in data to search/filter out results from the data structure.
