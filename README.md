# Pokemon Database
This program is more of a random experimental type thing. I know I want to first make a simple webpage. Then add a backend. Then improve upon it for the front end. This will be a program that helps improve my full stack development skills. 
Languages that will be in use: HTML, CSS, SQL, and Javascript.
