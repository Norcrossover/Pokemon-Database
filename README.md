# PokemonDatabase
INTRO:
This program is more of a random experimental type thing. I know I want to first make a simple webpage. Then add a backend. Then improve upon it for the front end. This will be a program that helps improve my full stack development skills. 

LANGUAGES USED:
HTML, CSS, and SQL

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
Now I know what this program will be. It will be a webpage that will allow users to search up various stats or information they want. In the front end it may be check boxes, buttons, and maybe typing in for ranges and what not. On the back end, the input will trigger a search query.

INSPIRATION:
This program's idea is inspired by my most recent hobby of playing Pokemon Nuzlockes on stream or for fun. Having my own database to search up various stats would be very beneficial to have during gameplay.
